# The modern web is basically malware at this point.

I was looking at a "minimalist" landing page the other day and the dev tools showed **12mb of javascript**. For a page with three buttons and a logo. Are we okay?

* Developers are importing entire ecosystems just to handle a toggle menu. If you need 500kb of react code for a STATIC site, you aren't an engineer.
* 60% of your load time is just a dozen different analytics scripts trying to figure out how long you hovered over a "buy now" button. 
* We've reached a point where we have frameworks to fix the performance issues caused by the *other* frameworks we're already using. 

I built virex.lol to be fast because I actually respect your hardware. The average webpage in 2026 is over 2.5mb, most of which is just "management overhead" and ads. 

We don't need more "ai-native" features or 3d micro interactions. We need people to remember how to write a basic media query and ship some damn html once in a while, even if it's ugly.

If your site takes more than 2 seconds to be interactive on a 4g connection, you didn't build a website. Please stop!!!

# Stop trusting corporations to keep your data safe. 

I have massive amounts of storage for a reason. People think im crazy for archiving games, software, and gallery backups, but have you even seen the state of the internet lately?
People call me crazy until it actually comes useful and you lose stuff forever. The internet is made to have temporary-first data.

* If it's on my drive, no one can "un-license" it or edit the content after the fact.
* Paying $15 a month for a library that changes every week is a joke.
* I keep games, movies, music, tools, and old software because once they're gone from the main web, they're gone FOREVER.

I'm running huge amounts of storage on my local rig for a reason. It's not just about hoarding. It's about digital sovereignty. Plus, having local access to my entire music and libraries without worrying about deletion or "Site is down" is a huge advantage.

Everyone is so comfortable with streaming and cloud storage until the servers go dark, the license expires, or even worse? Data loss. They don't care about your files, they care about your subscription. That is why I archive everything!

# Why Arch? (unironically)

Honestly if I were to see one more person say "I use Arch btw" as a joke I might actually lose it. On a serious note, I use it because I dont want some random distro maintainer deciding what packages I need to have installed.

* **No bloat:** I have exactly what I need and nothing else. 
* **The Wiki:** Literally the holy grail of 'perfect' documentation. If it’s not in the wiki, it probably doesnt even exist.
* **Rolling release:** Yes, I want the latest kernel features immediately, and NOT in six months when the "stable" release feels like prehistoric technology.

My current rig is running an RX 6800xt and an i5 14600k, and honestly, setting up the drivers manually (Which is still incredibly easy) is much better than fighting a "user-friendly" os that tries to hide the literal config files from you. 

If you want to spend your life clicking "remind me later" on ANY operating system updates, go for it. I'll just be over here actually owning my hardware.

I've been looking at the traffic patterns on the major socials and it's literally just bots talking to bots. 
It's now just a loop of ai-generated slop being consumed by ai-generated scrapers. Dystopian right?

* You post a thought, and three seconds later, five "blue checks" with generic ai names reply with something vaguely related.
* We aren't even being shown what's good anymore, rather, we're just being shown what keeps us scrolling for 0.5 seconds longer. 
* You can't have a debate anymore because the "person" you are arguing with is probably a clanker running on a server in a basement somewhere.


Everyone is so obsessed with "The future of AI" that they didn't even notice it already killed the world wide web.

Go outside. Or at least close a tab. There is soon going to be nothing left for us here.

# The most transparent administration I guess?

The DOJ literally just dropped a bunch of documents that are so redacted they look like modern art.

Apparently, they missed the deadline set by the transparency act and are now doing "rolling releases" slash slash.. batches, which is just code for "we're still redacting."

Some files even "disappeared" from the site after being posted, including photos that actually featured the current admin.

Lawmakers are already talking about impeachment and contempt because the DOJ is basically treating federal law like a literal suggestion!

It's honestly really embarrassing how much effort is going into hiding names when the law specifically said no redactions for "political sensitivity.", and that turned into a "we'll redact everything and call it a day" situation.

> The United States is literally one big social experiment.
